Let's turn our attention to the client-side and add [React](https://reactjs.org/)...

---

React is a declarative, component-based, JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

If you're new to React, review the [Quick Start](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) and the excellent [Why did we build React?](https://reactjs.org/blog/2013/06/05/why-react.html) blog post. You may also want to step through the [Intro to React](https://github.com/mjhea0/react-intro) tutorial to learn more about [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) - and how they work beneath the scenes.

Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed before continuing:

```sh
$ node -v
v8.7.0
$ npm -v
5.4.2
```

### Project Setup

We'll use the amazing [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) CLI to generate a boilerplate that's all set up and ready to go.

> Again, it's important to understand what's happening under the hood with Webpack and babel. For more, check out the [Intro to React](https://github.com/mjhea0/react-intro) tutorial.

Start by installing Create React App globally:

```sh
$ npm install create-react-app@1.4.2 --global
```

Add a new directory to the project root called "client" and create the boilerplate:

```sh
$ create-react-app .
```

Along with creating the basic project structure, this will also install all dependencies. Once done, start the server:

```sh
$ npm start
```

After staring the server, Create React App automatically launches the app in your default browser on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Ensure all is well, and then kill the server.

Next, to simplify the development process, let's tell npm not to create a [package-lock.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package-lock.json) file for this project:

```sh
$ echo 'package-lock=false' >> .npmrc
```

> Review the [npm docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/npmrc) for more info on the *.npmrc* config file.

Now we're ready build our first component!

### First Component

First, to simplify the structure, remove the *App.css*, *App.js*, *App.test.js*, and *index.css* from the "src" folder, and then update *index.js*:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="container">
      <div className="row">
        <div className="col-md-4">
          <br/>
          <h1>All Users</h1>
          <hr/><br/>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
};

ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

What's happening?

1. After importing the `React` and `ReactDom` classes, we created a functional component called `App`, which returns [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/).
1. We then use the `render` method from `ReactDOM` to mount the App to the DOM into the HTML element with an ID of `root`.

    > Take note of `<div id="root"></div>` within the *index.html* file in the "public" folder.

Add Bootstrap to *index.html* in the `head`:

```html
<link
  href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"
  rel="stylesheet"
>
```

### Class-based Component

Update *index.js*:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class App extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="container">
        <div className="row">
          <div className="col-md-4">
            <br/>
            <h1>All Users</h1>
            <hr/><br/>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    )
  }
};

ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

What's happening?

1. We created a class-based component, which runs automatically when an instance is created (behind the scenes).
1. When ran, `super()` calls the constructor of `Component`, which `App` extends from.

You may have already noticed, but the output is the exact same as before, despite using a class-based component. We'll look at the differences between the two shortly!

### AJAX

To connect the client to the server, add a `getUsers()` method to the `App` class, which uses [Axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) to manage the AJAX call:

```javascript
getUsers() {
  axios.get(`${process.env.REACT_APP_USERS_SERVICE_URL}/users`)
  .then((res) => { console.log(res); })
  .catch((err) => { console.log(err); });
}
```

Install Axios:

```sh
$ npm install axios@0.16.2 --save
```

Add the import:

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';
```

You should now have:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import axios from 'axios';

class App extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }
  getUsers() {
    axios.get(`${process.env.REACT_APP_USERS_SERVICE_URL}/users`)
    .then((res) => { console.log(res); })
    .catch((err) => { console.log(err); });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="container">
        <div className="row">
          <div className="col-md-4">
            <br/>
            <h1>All Users</h1>
            <hr/><br/>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    )
  }
};

ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

To connect this up to the users service, open a new terminal window, navigate to the project root, set `testdriven-dev` as the active Docker Machine:

```sh
$ docker-machine env testdriven-dev
$ eval $(docker-machine env testdriven-dev)
```

Update the containers:

```sh
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up -d
```

Ensure the app is working in the browser, and then run the tests:

```sh
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml \
  run users-service python manage.py test
```

Now, turning back to React, we need to add the [environment variable](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-custom-environment-variables) `process.env.REACT_APP_USERS_SERVICE_URL`. Kill the Create React App server, and then run:

```sh
$ export REACT_APP_USERS_SERVICE_URL=http://DOCKER_MACHINE_DEV_IP
```

> All custom environment variables must begin with `REACT_APP_`. For more, check out the [official docs](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-custom-environment-variables).

We still need to call the `getUsers()` method, which we can do, for now, in the `constructor()`:

```javascript
constructor() {
  super();
  this.getUsers();
};
```

Run the server - via `npm start` - and then within [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools), open the JavaScript Console. You should see the following error:

```
Failed to load http://192.168.99.100/users:
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
Origin 'http://localhost:3000' is therefore not allowed access.
```

In short, we're making a [cross-origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) AJAX request (from `http://localhost:3000` to `http://192.168.99.100`), which is a violation of the browsers "same origin policy". Fortunately, we can use the [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) extension to handle this.

Within the "users-service" directory, add Flask-CORS to the *requirements.txt* file:

```
flask-cors==3.0.3
```

To keep things simple, let's allow cross origin requests on all routes, from any domain. Simply update `create_app()` in *users-service/project/\_\_init\_\_.py* like so:

```python
def create_app():

    # instantiate the app
    app = Flask(__name__)

    # enable CORS
    CORS(app)

    # set config
    app_settings = os.getenv('APP_SETTINGS')
    app.config.from_object(app_settings)

    # set up extensions
    db.init_app(app)

    # register blueprints
    from project.api.users import users_blueprint
    app.register_blueprint(users_blueprint)

    return app
```

Add the import at the top:

```python
from flask_cors import CORS
```

To test, start by updating the containers:

```sh
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up -d --build
```

Then, update and seed the database:

```sh
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml \
  run users-service python manage.py recreate_db

$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml \
  run users-service python manage.py seed_db
```

fire back up both servers, open the JavaScript Console again, and this time you should see the results of `console.log(res);`.

Let's parse the JSON object:

```javascript
getUsers() {
  axios.get(`${process.env.REACT_APP_USERS_SERVICE_URL}/users`)
  .then((res) => { console.log(res.data.data); })
  .catch((err) => { console.log(err); })
}
```

Now you should have an array with two objects in the JavaScript Console:

```json
[
  {
    "active": true,
    "email": "michael@realpython.com",
    "id": 1,
    "username": "michael"
  },
  {
    "active": true,
    "email": "michael@mherman.org",
    "id": 2,
    "username": "michaelherman"
  }
]
```

Before we move on, we need to do a quick refactor. Remember how we called the `getUsers()` method in the constructor?

```javascript
constructor() {
  super();
  this.getUsers();
};
```

Well, the `constructor()` fires *before* the component is mounted to the DOM. What would happen if the AJAX request took longer than expected and the component was mounted before it was complete? This introduces a [race condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition). Fortunately, React makes it fairly simple to correct this via Lifecycle Methods.

### Component Lifecycle Methods

Class-based components have several functions available to them that execute at certain times during the life of the component. These are called Lifecycle Methods. Take a quick look at the [official documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#the-component-lifecycle) to learn about each method and when each is called.

The AJAX calls [should be made](https://daveceddia.com/where-fetch-data-componentwillmount-vs-componentdidmount/) in the `componentDidMount()` method:

```javascript
componentDidMount() {
  this.getUsers();
};
```

Update the component:

```javascript
class App extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
  };
  componentDidMount() {
    this.getUsers();
  };
  getUsers() {
    axios.get(`${process.env.REACT_APP_USERS_SERVICE_URL}/users`)
    .then((res) => { console.log(res.data.data.users); })
    .catch((err) => { console.log(err); })
  };
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="container">
        <div className="row">
          <div className="col-md-4">
            <br/>
            <h1>All Users</h1>
            <hr/><br/>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    )
  }
};

ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Make sure everything still works as it did before.

### State

To add the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)">state</a> - i.e., the users - to the component we need to use `setState()`, which is an asynchronous function use to update state.

Update `getUsers()`:

```javascript
getUsers() {
  axios.get(`${process.env.REACT_APP_USERS_SERVICE_URL}/users`)
  .then((res) => { this.setState({ users: res.data.data.users }); })
  .catch((err) => { console.log(err); });
};
```

Add state to the constructor:

```javascript
constructor() {
  super();
  this.state = {
    users: []
  };
};
```

So, `this.state` adds the state `property` to the class and sets `users` to an empty array.

> Review [Using State Correctly](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#using-state-correctly) from the official docs.

Finally, update the `render()` method to display the data returned from the AJAX call to the end user:

```javascript
render() {
  return (
    <div className="container">
      <div className="row">
        <div className="col-md-6">
          <br/>
          <h1>All Users</h1>
          <hr/><br/>
          {
            this.state.users.map((user) => {
              return (
                <h4
                  key={user.id}
                  className="well"
                >{ user.username }
                </h4>
              )
            })
          }
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

What's happening?

1. We iterated over the users (from the AJAX request) and created a new H4 element. This is why we needed to set an initial state of an empty array - it prevents `map` from exploding.
1. `key`? - used by React to keep track of each element. Review the [official docs](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/lists-and-keys.html#keys) for more.

### Functional Component

Let's create a new component for the users list. Add a new folder called "components" to "src". Add a new file to that folder called *UsersList.jsx*:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const UsersList = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      {
        props.users.map((user) => {
          return (
            <h4
              key={user.id}
              className="well"
            >{user.username}
            </h4>
          )
        })
      }
    </div>
  )
};

export default UsersList;
```

Why did we use a functional component here rather than a class-based component?

Notice how we used `props` instead of `state` in this component. Essentially, you can pass state to a component with either `props` or `state`:

1. Props - data flows down via `props` (from `state` to `props`), read only
1. State - data is tied to a component, read and write

> For more, check out [ReactJS: Props vs. State](http://lucybain.com/blog/2016/react-state-vs-pros/).

It's a good practice to limit the number of class-based (stateful) components since they can manipulate state and are, thus, less predictable. If you just need to render data (like in the above case), then use a functional (state-less) component.

Now we need to pass state from the parent to the child component via `props`. First, add the import to *index.js*:

```javascript
import UsersList from './components/UsersList';
```

Then, update the `render()` method:

```javascript
render() {
  return (
    <div className="container">
      <div className="row">
        <div className="col-md-6">
          <br/>
          <h1>All Users</h1>
          <hr/><br/>
            <UsersList users={this.state.users}/>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Review the code in each component and add comments as necessary. Commit your code.
