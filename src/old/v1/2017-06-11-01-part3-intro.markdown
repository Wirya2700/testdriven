In Part 3, we'll add *database migrations* along with *password hashing* in order to implement *token-based authentication* to the users service with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). We'll then turn our attention to the client and add *React Router* to the React app to enable client-side routing along with client-side authentication.

By the end of part 3, you should be able to...

1. Use Flask Migrate to handle database migrations
1. Configure Flask Bcrypt for password hashing
1. Implement user authentication with JWTs
1. Write tests to create and verify JWTs and user authentication
1. Use React Router to define client-side routes in React
1. Build UI components with React Bootstrap
1. Explain the difference between user authentication and authorization
1. Implement user authorization

You can also test out the following endpoints...

| Endpoint        | HTTP Method | Authenticated?  | Result            |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| /auth/register  | POST        | No              | register user     |
| /auth/login     | POST        | No              | log in user       |
| /auth/logout    | GET         | Yes             | log out user      |
| /auth/status    | GET         | Yes             | check user status |
| /users          | GET         | No              | get all users     |
| /users/:id      | GET         | No              | get single user   |
| /users          | POST        | Yes (admin)     | add a user        |
| /ping           | GET         | No              | sanity check      |
