In Part 4, we'll add an *end-to-end* (e2e) testing solution, *form validation* to the React app, a *[Swagger](https://swagger.io/)* service to document the API, and deal with some tech debt. We'll also set up a staging environment to test on before the app goes into production.

#### <span style="font-family:'Montserrat', 'sans-serif';">Objectives</span>

By the end of part 4, you should be able to...

1. Test the entire set of services with functional, end-to-end tests via TestCafe
1. Integrate TestCafe into the continuous integration process
1. Handle form validation within React
1. Add a flash messaging system to the React app
1. Describe the purpose of Swagger
1. Generate a Swagger Spec based on an existing RESTful API
1. Configure Swagger to interact with a service running inside a Docker Container
1. Set up a staging environment on AWS

Check out the live app, running on EC2 - http://testdriven-production-alb-484275327.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com

You can also test out the following endpoints...

| Endpoint        | HTTP Method | Authenticated?  | Result            |
